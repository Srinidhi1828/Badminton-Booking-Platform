Badminton Booking Platform:

The Badminton Booking Platform is a modern web application designed to make court reservations simple, fast, and user-friendly. It allows players to book badminton courts, rent equipment, schedule training sessions with professional coaches, and view all their upcoming or past bookings in one place. Built with a clean interface and smooth user flow, the platform focuses on delivering a seamless digital experience for both casual users and regular players.

This project is created using React (Vite) for the frontend and integrates with APIs for booking, pricing, and availability checks. The goal is to replace the outdated manual booking process with a smarter, automated system that reduces friction and saves time.

Key Features:
1. Court Booking

Users can select their preferred date, start time, end time, and court type. The UI automatically updates pricing and availability in real time, ensuring clarity before confirming a booking.

2. Equipment Rental

Players can choose from a list of available equipment such as rackets, shuttlecocks, and shoes. Quantity selection is supported, and the cost is automatically added to the total breakdown.

3. Coach Selection

Users can optionally book a certified coach for their training session. Fees are integrated directly into the pricing system for transparency.

4. Dynamic Price Breakdown

A separate card displays a complete price estimate:

Base court fee
Equipment charges
Coach fee
Surcharges
Multipliers
Final total

This helps users understand exactly what they are paying for.

5. Booking Management (My Bookings)

Users can view all past and upcoming bookings stored locally. The interface is clean and simple, showing date, time, and booking details, along with an option to cancel.

6. Fully Responsive Design

The entire application adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experience.

Purpose of the Project:

The primary objective is to digitize and streamline the badminton reservation experience. Sports centers often rely on phone calls or paperwork, which are inefficient and prone to errors. This application automates the entire flow—from choosing a slot to confirming a booking—making the process modern and hassle-free.

🛠 Technologies Used

React (Vite)

JavaScript (ES6)

CSS

Axios

LocalStorage for temporary user data

REST APIs for booking and pricing

Status:

This is an active project and will continue to evolve with improvements such as payment integration, user authentication, and enhanced booking analytics.




# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
